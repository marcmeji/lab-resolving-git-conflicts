DIFFERENT conflict
# Who am I

* Where are you from? I was NOT born in Barcelona.
* What do you do? I am a biologist.
* Do you have previous experience with technology/data? Not much.

# Why am I here

* What has brought you to Ironhack? I want to change my career.
* What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp? I would like to learn as much as possible.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Which industry will you seek employment in? I am still not sure.
* What will your future role look like? As in the last question, I am still not sure.
* What is your career goal? I would like to find a job that stimulates me and keeps me learning every day, but 
definitely, we all work for money, so I would like to find a well payed stimulating job (I hope those exist!).
